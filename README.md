No lectures, no clich√©s ‚Äî just a stable, mature, and supportive presence.

A mentor who listens. Available anytime, he helps you move forward, understand yourself and others better, and make clearer decisions.
For those who had to figure it out alone, it's a way to finally have a point of reference ‚Äî step by step, at your pace.

## Does DadGPT replace a therapy?

**No.**

Although [several studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/17/a-new-study-says-chatgpt-is-a-better-therapist-than-humans---scientists-explain-why/) indicate that recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the refinement of consumer models [often make them better therapists than real therapists](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-chatgpt-psychotherapy-28415/), DadGPT is not a psychologist and cannot claim the titles of "psychologist," "therapist," "psychotherapist," "psychoanalyst," or "psychopractitioner."

Artificial intelligences (AIs) can be very helpful in daily life as well as for more specific and delicate topics; however, it is important to keep in mind that they have insurmountable technical limitations: They do not have free will or awareness of imminent danger, and they do what they have been programmed to do without distinguishing between right and wrong.

If you or someone close to you is facing significant psychological difficulties such as depression, suicidal thoughts, eating disorders, or anything else: [SEEK HELP](https://988lifeline.org/).
