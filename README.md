# DadGPT - A Father Figure for Those Who Grew Up Without One 👨🏻



## What is DadGPT?

A father figure for those who grew up without one 👨🏻

DadGPT is an AI designed for men who grew up without a reliable male role model.
It offers a steady presence, practical advice, and direct answers to the questions we don't always dare to ask.
It's an assistant built to feel like a father figure — someone you can talk to, ask questions, get guidance or support from — with no judgment, no pressure.

You can talk about anything: relationships, career, self-confidence, emotions, life choices… He's here to guide you, listen to you, encourage you, or simply help you take a step back.
No lectures, no clichés — just a stable, mature, and supportive presence.

A mentor who listens. Available anytime, he helps you move forward, understand yourself and others better, and make clearer decisions.
For those who had to figure it out alone, it's a way to finally have a point of reference — step by step, at your pace.

**DadGPT isn't a therapis**t — it's a support figure for those who never had one.

Try it. Talk. Ask a question. You've got nothing to lose — and maybe a steady guide to gain.

**Messages exchanged with DadGPT are not used to train the model.**

DadGPT is hosted by OpenAI, whose [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/row-terms-of-use/) apply.

The retention period for conversations with DadGPT cannot exceed 31 days in accordance with [OpenAI's Terms of Service](https://openai.com/policies/).


## Does DadGPT replace a therapy?

**No.**

Although [several studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/17/a-new-study-says-chatgpt-is-a-better-therapist-than-humans---scientists-explain-why/) indicate that recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and the refinement of consumer models [often make them better therapists than real therapists](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-chatgpt-psychotherapy-28415/), DadGPT is not a psychologist and cannot claim the titles of "psychologist," "therapist," "psychotherapist," "psychoanalyst," or "psychopractitioner."

Artificial intelligences (AIs) can be very helpful in daily life as well as for more specific and delicate topics; however, it is important to keep in mind that they have insurmountable technical limitations: They do not have free will or awareness of imminent danger, and they do what they have been programmed to do without distinguishing between right and wrong.
